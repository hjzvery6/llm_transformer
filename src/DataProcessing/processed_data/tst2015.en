Intelligence -- what is it?
If we take a look back at the history of how intelligence has been viewed, one seminal example has been Edsger Dijkstra's famous quote that "the question of whether a machine can think is about as interesting as the question of whether a submarine can swim."
Now, Edsger Dijkstra, when he wrote this, intended it as a criticism of the early pioneers of computer science, like Alan Turing.
However, if you take a look back and think about what have been the most empowering innovations that enabled us to build artificial machines that swim and artificial machines that [fly], you find that it was only through understanding the underlying physical mechanisms of swimming and flight that we were able to build these machines.
And so, several years ago, I undertook a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms underlying intelligence.
Let's take a step back.
Let's first begin with a thought experiment.
Pretend that you're an alien race that doesn't know anything about Earth biology or Earth neuroscience or Earth intelligence, but you have amazing telescopes and you're able to watch the Earth, and you have amazingly long lives, so you're able to watch the Earth over millions, even billions of years.
And you observe a really strange effect.
You observe that, over the course of the millennia, Earth is continually bombarded with asteroids up until a point, and that at some point, corresponding roughly to our year, 2000 AD, asteroids that are on a collision course with the Earth that otherwise would have collided mysteriously get deflected or they detonate before they can hit the Earth.
Now of course, as earthlings, we know the reason would be that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to prevent an impact.
But if you're an alien race who doesn't know any of this, doesn't have any concept of Earth intelligence, you'd be forced to put together a physical theory that explains how, up until a certain point in time, asteroids that would demolish the surface of a planet mysteriously stop doing that.
And so I claim that this is the same question as understanding the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that I undertook several years ago, I looked at a variety of different threads across science, across a variety of disciplines, that were pointing, I think, towards a single, underlying mechanism for intelligence.
And so, taking all of these different threads and putting them together, I asked, starting several years ago, is there an underlying mechanism for intelligence that we can factor out of all of these different threads?
Is there a single equation for intelligence?
And the answer, I believe, is yes. ["F = T ∇ Sτ"] What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent to an E = mc² for intelligence that I've seen.
So what you're seeing here is a statement of correspondence that intelligence is a force, F, that acts so as to maximize future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize future freedom of action, or keep options open, with some strength T, with the diversity of possible accessible futures, S, up to some future time horizon, tau.
In short, intelligence doesn't like to get trapped.
Intelligence tries to maximize future freedom of action and keep options open.
And so, given this one equation, it's natural to ask, so what can you do with this?
How predictive is it?
Does it predict human-level intelligence?
Does it predict artificial intelligence?
So I'm going to show you now a video that will, I think, demonstrate some of the amazing applications of just this single equation.
But what if that tentative cosmological connection between entropy and intelligence hints at a deeper relationship?
What if intelligent behavior doesn't just correlate with the production of long-term entropy, but actually emerges directly from it?
To find out, we developed a software engine called Entropica, designed to maximize the production of long-term entropy of any system that it finds itself in.
Amazingly, Entropica was able to pass multiple animal intelligence tests, play human games, and even earn money trading stocks, all without being instructed to do so.
Here are some examples of Entropica in action.
Just like a human standing upright without falling over, here we see Entropica automatically balancing a pole using a cart.
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave Entropica a goal.
It simply decided on its own to balance the pole.
This balancing ability will have appliactions for humanoid robotics and human assistive technologies.
Just as some animals can use objects in their environments as tools to reach into narrow spaces, here we see that Entropica, again on its own initiative, was able to move a large disk representing an animal around so as to cause a small disk, representing a tool, to reach into a confined space holding a third disk and release the third disk from its initially fixed position.
This tool use ability will have applications for smart manufacturing and agriculture.
In addition, just as some other animals are able to cooperate by pulling opposite ends of a rope at the same time to release food, here we see that Entropica is able to accomplish a model version of that task.
This cooperative ability has interesting implications for economic planning and a variety of other fields.
Entropica is broadly applicable to a variety of domains.
For example, here we see it successfully playing a game of pong against itself, illustrating its potential for gaming.
Here we see Entropica orchestrating new connections on a social network where friends are constantly falling out of touch and successfully keeping the network well connected.
This same network orchestration ability also has applications in health care, energy, and intelligence.
Here we see Entropica directing the paths of a fleet of ships, successfully discovering and utilizing the Panama Canal to globally extend its reach from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
By the same token, Entropica is broadly applicable to problems in autonomous defense, logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see Entropica spontaneously discovering and executing a buy-low, sell-high strategy on a simulated range traded stock, successfully growing assets under management exponentially.
This risk management ability will have broad applications in finance and insurance.
Alex Wissner-Gross: So what you've just seen is that a variety of signature human intelligent cognitive behaviors such as tool use and walking upright and social cooperation all follow from a single equation, which drives a system to maximize its future freedom of action.
Now, there's a profound irony here.
Going back to the beginning of the usage of the term robot, the play "RUR," there was always a concept that if we developed machine intelligence, there would be a cybernetic revolt.
The machines would rise up against us.
One major consequence of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had the whole concept of cybernetic revolt in reverse.
It's not that machines first become intelligent and then megalomaniacal and try to take over the world.
Another important consequence is goal seeking.
I'm often asked, how does the ability to seek goals follow from this sort of framework?
Finally, Richard Feynman, famous physicist, once wrote that if human civilization were destroyed and you could pass only a single concept on to our descendants to help them rebuild civilization, that concept should be that all matter around us is made out of tiny elements that attract each other when they're far apart but repel each other when they're close together.
My equivalent of that statement to pass on to descendants to help them build artificial intelligences or to help them understand human intelligence, is the following: Intelligence should be viewed as a physical process that tries to maximize future freedom of action and avoid constraints in its own future.
Thank you very much.
If you're going to be real with someone, you gotta be ready for real in return.
So hard conversations are still not my strong suit.
Ask anybody I have ever dated.
But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call the three Pancake Girl principles.
Now, please view this through gay-colored lenses, but know what it takes to come out of any closet is essentially the same.
Number one: Be authentic.
Take the armor off. Be yourself.
That kid in the cafe had no armor, but I was ready for battle.
If you want someone to be real with you, they need to know that you bleed too.
Number two: Be direct. Just say it. Rip the Band-Aid off.
If you know you are gay, just say it.
If you tell your parents you might be gay, they will hold out hope that this will change.
Do not give them that sense of false hope.
You are speaking your truth.
Never apologize for that.
And some folks may have gotten hurt along the way, so sure, apologize for what you've done, but never apologize for who you are.
And yeah, some folks may be disappointed, but that is on them, not on you.
Those are their expectations of who you are, not yours.
That is their story, not yours.
The only story that matters is the one that you want to write.
So the next time you find yourself in a pitch-black closet clutching your grenade, know we have all been there before.
And you may feel so very alone, but you are not.
And we know it's hard but we need you out here, no matter what your walls are made of, because I guarantee you there are others peering through the keyholes of their closets looking for the next brave soul to bust a door open, so be that person and show the world that we are bigger than our closets and that a closet is no place for a person to truly live.
Dear brothers and sisters, we learned from her how to be resilient in the most difficult times, and I'm glad to share with you that despite being an icon for the rights of children and women, she is like any 16-year old girl.
She cries when her homework is incomplete.
She quarrels with her brothers, and I am very happy for that.
People ask me, what special is in my mentorship which has made Malala so bold and so courageous and so vocal and poised?
I tell them, don't ask me what I did.
Ask me what I did not do.
I did not clip her wings, and that's all.
Thank you very much.
And on the bottom she writes, "P.S. When I visited San Francisco General Hospital that evening, you were listed as the patient.
Boy, did I have to straighten that one out."
Today, Kevin is a loving father and contributing member of society.
He speaks openly about the events that day and his depression in the hopes that his story will inspire others.
Suicide is not just something I've encountered on the job.
It's personal.
My grandfather committed suicide by poisoning.
That act, although ending his own pain, robbed me from ever getting to know him.
This is what suicide does.
For most suicidal folks, or those contemplating suicide, they wouldn't think of hurting another person.
They just want their own pain to end.
Typically, this is accomplished in just three ways: sleep, drugs or alcohol, or death.
In my career, I've responded to and been involved in hundreds of mental illness and suicide calls around the bridge.
Of those incidents I've been directly involved with, I've only lost two, but that's two too many.
One was Jason.
The other was a man I spoke to for about an hour.
During that time, he shook my hand on three occasions.
On that final handshake, he looked at me, and he said, "Kevin, I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And he leapt.
I do want to tell you, though, the vast majority of folks that we do get to contact on that bridge do not commit suicide.
Additionally, that very few who have jumped off the bridge and lived and can talk about it, that one to two percent, most of those folks have said that the second that they let go of that rail, they knew that they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge not only connects Marin to San Francisco, but people together also.
That connection, or bridge that we make, is something that each and every one of us should strive to do.
Suicide is preventable.
There is help. There is hope.
Thank you very much.
In effect, he's proposing a fundamental law of consciousness: high phi, high consciousness.
Now, I don't know if this theory is right, but it's actually perhaps the leading theory right now in the science of consciousness, and it's been used to integrate a whole range of scientific data, and it does have a nice property that it is in fact simple enough you can write it on the front of a t-shirt.
Another final motivation is that panpsychism might help us to integrate consciousness into the physical world.
Physicists and philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a bunch of equations, but it doesn't tell us about the reality that underlies it.
As Stephen Hawking puts it, what puts the fire into the equations?
Well, on the panpsychist view, you can leave the equations of physics as they are, but you can take them to be describing the flux of consciousness.
That's what physics really is ultimately doing, describing the flux of consciousness.
On this view, it's consciousness that puts the fire into the equations.
On that view, consciousness doesn't dangle outside the physical world as some kind of extra.
It's there right at its heart.
This view, I think, the panpsychist view, has the potential to transfigure our relationship to nature, and it may have some pretty serious social and ethical consequences.
Some of these may be counterintuitive.
I used to think I shouldn't eat anything which is conscious, so therefore I should be vegetarian.
Now, if you're a panpsychist and you take that view, you're going to go very hungry.
So I think when you think about it, this tends to transfigure your views, whereas what matters for ethical purposes and moral considerations, not so much the fact of consciousness, but the degree and the complexity of consciousness.
It's also natural to ask about consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificially intelligent system in the movie "Her," Samantha?
Is she conscious?
Well, if you take the informational, panpsychist view, she certainly has complicated information processing and integration, so the answer is very likely yes, she is conscious.
If that's right, it raises pretty serious ethical issues about both the ethics of developing intelligent computer systems and the ethics of turning them off.
Finally, you might ask about the consciousness of whole groups, the planet.
Does Canada have its own consciousness?
Or at a more local level, does an integrated group like the audience at a TED conference, are we right now having a collective TED consciousness, an inner movie for this collective TED group which is distinct from the inner movies of each of our parts?
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think it's at least one worth taking seriously.
Okay, so this panpsychist vision, it is a radical one, and I don't know that it's correct.
I'm actually more confident about the first crazy idea, that consciousness is fundamental, than about the second one, that it's universal.
I mean, the view raises any number of questions, has any number of challenges, like how do those little bits of consciousness add up to the kind of complex consciousness we know and love.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going to be well on our way to a serious theory of consciousness.
If not, well, this is the hardest problem perhaps in science and philosophy.
We can't expect to solve it overnight.
But I do think we're going to figure it out eventually.
Understanding consciousness is a real key, I think, both to understanding the universe and to understanding ourselves.
It may just take the right crazy idea.
Thank you.
