This may sound strange, but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.
The first concrete blocks were manufactured in 1868 with a very simple idea: modules made of cement of a fixed measurement that fit together.
Very quickly concrete blocks became the most-used construction unit in the world.
They enabled us to to build things that were larger than us, buildings, bridges, one brick at a time.
Essentially concrete blocks had become the building block of our time.
Almost a hundred years later in 1947, LEGO came up with this.
It was called the Automatic Binding Brick.
And in a few short years, LEGO bricks took place in every household.
It's estimated that over 400 billion bricks have been produced -- or 75 bricks for every person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to make beautiful houses, beautiful bridges, beautiful buildings.
LEGO made it accessible.
LEGO has essentially taken the concrete block, the building block of the world, and made it into the building block of our imagination.
Meanwhile the exact same year, at Bell Labs the next revolution was about to be announced, the next building block.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of static bricks piled on top of each other to a world where everything was interactive.
Like the concrete block, the transistor allows you to build much larger, more complex circuits, one brick at a time.
But there's a main difference: The transistor was only for experts.
I personally don't accept this, that the building block of our time is reserved for experts, so I decided to change that.
Eight years ago when I was at the Media Lab, I started exploring this idea of how to put the power of engineers in the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago I started developing littleBits.
Let me show you how they work.
LittleBits are electronic modules with each one specific function.
They're pre-engineered to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best part about it is they snap together with magnets.
So you can't put them the wrong way.
The bricks are color-coded.
Green is output, blue is power, pink is input and orange is wire.
So all you need to do is snap a blue to a green and very quickly you can start making larger circuits.
You put a blue to a green, you can make light.
You can put a knob in between and now you've made a little dimmer.
Switch out the knob for a pulse module, which is here, and now you've made a little blinker.
Add this buzzer for some extra punch and you've created a noise machine.
I'm going to stop that.
So beyond simple play, littleBits are actually pretty powerful.
Instead of having to program, to wire, to solder, littleBits allow you to program using very simple intuitive gestures.
So to make this blink faster or slower, you would just turn this knob and basically make it pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind littleBits is that it's a growing library.
We want to make every single interaction in the world into a ready-to-use brick.
Lights, sounds, solar panels, motors -- everything should be accessible.
We've been giving littleBits to kids and seeing them play with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The nicest thing is how they start to understand the electronics around them from everyday that they don't learn at schools.
For example, how a nightlight works, or why an elevator door stays open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also been taking littleBits to design schools.
So for example, we've had designers with no experience with electronics whatsoever start to play with littleBits as a material.
Here you see, with felt and paper water bottles, we have Geordie making ...
A few weeks ago we took littleBits to RISD and gave them to some designers with no experience in engineering whatsoever -- just cardboard, wood and paper -- and told them "Make something."
Here's an example of a project they made, a motion-activated confetti canon ball.
But wait, this is actually my favorite project.
It's a lobster made of playdough that's afraid of the dark.
To these non-engineers, littleBits became another material, electronics became just another material.
And we want to make this material accessible to everyone.
So littleBits is open-source.
You can go on the website, download all the design files, make them yourself.
We want to encourage a world of creators, of inventors, of contributors, because this world that we live in, this interactive world, is ours.
So go ahead and start inventing.
Thank you.
So Western governments are providing totalitarian governments with tools to do this against their own citizens.
But Western governments are doing it to themselves as well.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago the so-called State Trojan was found, which was a trojan used by German government officials to investigate their own citizens.
If you are a suspect in a criminal case, well it's pretty obvious, your phone will be tapped.
But today, it goes beyond that.
They will tap your Internet connection.
They will even use tools like State Trojan to infect your computer with a trojan, which enables them to watch all your communication, to listen to your online discussions, to collect your passwords.
Now when we think deeper about things like these, the obvious response from people should be that, "Okay, that sounds bad, but that doesn't really affect me because I'm a legal citizen.
Why should I worry?
Because I have nothing to hide."
And this is an argument, which doesn't make sense.
Privacy is implied.
Privacy is not up for discussion.
This is not a question between privacy against security.
It's a question of freedom against control.
And while we might trust our governments right now, right here in 2011, any right we give away will be given away for good.
And do we trust, do we blindly trust, any future government, a government we might have 50 years from now?
And these are the questions that we have to worry about for the next 50 years.
And they will contest this because the evidence presented in an earlier mode is not in the way they would like the evidence presented.
For example, the anecdote that some present, as Captain so-and-so observed lots of fish in this area cannot be used or is usually not utilized by fishery scientists, because it's not "scientific."
So you have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we live in literate societies, because they don't trust the sources of the past.
And hence, the enormous role that a marine protected area can play.
Because with marine protected areas, we actually recreate the past.
We recreate the past that people cannot conceive because the baseline has shifted and is extremely low.
That is for people who can see a marine protected area and who can benefit from the insight that it provides, which enables them to reset their baseline.
How about the people who can't do that because they have no access -- the people in the Midwest for example?
There I think that the arts and film can perhaps fill the gap, and simulation.
This is a simulation of Chesapeake Bay.
There were gray whales in Chesapeake Bay a long time ago -- 500 years ago.
And you will have noticed that the hues and tones are like "Avatar."
And if you think about "Avatar," if you think of why people were so touched by it -- never mind the Pocahontas story -- why so touched by the imagery?
Because it evokes something that in a sense has been lost.
And so my recommendation, it's the only one I will provide, is for Cameron to do "Avatar II" underwater.
Thank you very much.
And the emerg. staff pulled out all the stops.
They gave her medications to raise her blood pressure.
They put her on a ventilator.
And I was shocked and shaken to the core.
And I went through this roller coaster, because after they stabilized her, she went to the intensive care unit, and I hoped against hope that she would recover.
And over the next two or three days, it was clear that she was never going to wake up.
She had irreversible brain damage.
And the family gathered.
And over the course of the next eight or nine days, they resigned themselves to what was happening.
And at about the nine day mark, they let her go -- Mrs. Drucker, a wife, a mother and a grandmother.
They say you never forget the names of those who die.
And that was my first time to be acquainted with that.
Over the next few weeks, I beat myself up and I experienced for the first time the unhealthy shame that exists in our culture of medicine -- where I felt alone, isolated, not feeling the healthy kind of shame that you feel, because you can't talk about it with your colleagues.
You know that healthy kind, when you betray a secret that a best friend made you promise never to reveal and then you get busted and then your best friend confronts you and you have terrible discussions, but at the end of it all that sick feeling guides you and you say, I'll never make that mistake again.
And you make amends and you never make that mistake again.
That's the kind of shame that is a teacher.
The unhealthy shame I'm talking about is the one that makes you so sick inside.
It's the one that says, not that what you did was bad, but that you are bad.
And it was what I was feeling.
And it wasn't because of my attending; he was a doll.
He talked to the family, and I'm quite sure that he smoothed things over and made sure that I didn't get sued.
And I kept asking myself these questions.
Why didn't I ask my attending? Why did I send her home?
And then at my worst moments: Why did I make such a stupid mistake?
Why did I go into medicine?
Slowly but surely, it lifted.
I began to feel a bit better.
And on a cloudy day, there was a crack in the clouds and the sun started to come out and I wondered, maybe I could feel better again.
And I made myself a bargain that if only I redouble my efforts to be perfect and never make another mistake again, please make the voices stop.
And they did.
And I went back to work.
And then it happened again.
Two years later I was an attending in the emergency department at a community hospital just north of Toronto, and I saw a 25 year-old man with a sore throat.
It was busy, I was in a bit of a hurry.
He kept pointing here.
I looked at his throat, it was a little bit pink.
And I gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him on his way.
And even as he was walking out the door, he was still sort of pointing to his throat.
And two days later I came to do my next emergency shift, and that's when my chief asked to speak to me quietly in her office.
And she said the three words: Do you remember?
"Do you remember that patient you saw with the sore throat?"
Well it turns out, he didn't have a strep throat.
He had a potentially life-threatening condition called epiglottitis.
You can Google it, but it's an infection, not of the throat, but of the upper airway, and it can actually cause the airway to close.
And fortunately he didn't die.
He was placed on intravenous antibiotics and he recovered after a few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and recriminations and felt cleansed and went back to work, until it happened again and again and again.
Twice in one emergency shift, I missed appendicitis.
Now that takes some doing, especially when you work in a hospital that at the time saw but 14 people a night.
Now in both cases, I didn't send them home and I don't think there was any gap in their care.
One I thought had a kidney stone.
I ordered a kidney X-ray. When it turned out to be normal, my colleague who was doing a reassessment of the patient noticed some tenderness in the right lower quadrant and called the surgeons.
The other one had a lot of diarrhea.
I ordered some fluids to rehydrate him and asked my colleague to reassess him.
And he did and when he noticed some tenderness in the right lower quadrant, called the surgeons.
In both cases, they had their operations and they did okay.
But each time, they were gnawing at me, eating at me.
And I'd like to be able to say to you that my worst mistakes only happened in the first five years of practice as many of my colleagues say, which is total B.S.
Some of my doozies have been in the last five years.
Alone, ashamed and unsupported.
Here's the problem: If I can't come clean and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the still-small voice that tells me what really happened, how can I share it with my colleagues?
How can I teach them about what I did so that they don't do the same thing?
If I were to walk into a room -- like right now, I have no idea what you think of me.
When was the last time you heard somebody talk about failure after failure after failure?
Oh yeah, you go to a cocktail party and you might hear about some other doctor, but you're not going to hear somebody talking about their own mistakes.
If I were to walk into a room filled with my colleages and ask for their support right now and start to tell what I've just told you right now, I probably wouldn't get through two of those stories before they would start to get really uncomfortable, somebody would crack a joke, they'd change the subject and we would move on.
And in fact, if I knew and my colleagues knew that one of my orthopedic colleagues took off the wrong leg in my hospital, believe me, I'd have trouble making eye contact with that person.
That's the system that we have.
It's a complete denial of mistakes.
It's a system in which there are two kinds of physicians -- those who make mistakes and those who don't, those who can't handle sleep deprivation and those who can, those who have lousy outcomes and those who have great outcomes.
And it's almost like an ideological reaction, like the antibodies begin to attack that person.
And we have this idea that if we drive the people who make mistakes out of medicine, what will we be left with, but a safe system.
But there are two problems with that.
In my 20 years or so of medical broadcasting and journalism, I've made a personal study of medical malpractice and medical errors to learn everything I can, from one of the first articles I wrote for the Toronto Star to my show "White Coat, Black Art."
And what I've learned is that errors are absolutely ubiquitous.
We work in a system where errors happen every day, where one in 10 medications are either the wrong medication given in hospital or at the wrong dosage, where hospital-acquired infections are getting more and more numerous, causing havoc and death.
In this country, as many as 24,000 Canadians die of preventable medical errors.
In the United States, the Institute of Medicine pegged it at 100,000.
In both cases, these are gross underestimates, because we really aren't ferreting out the problem as we should.
And here's the thing.
In a hospital system where medical knowledge is doubling every two or three years, we can't keep up with it.
Sleep deprivation is absolutely pervasive.
We can't get rid of it.
We have our cognitive biases, so that I can take a perfect history on a patient with chest pain.
Now take the same patient with chest pain, make them moist and garrulous and put a little bit of alcohol on their breath, and suddenly my history is laced with contempt.
I don't take the same history.
I'm not a robot; I don't do things the same way each time.
And my patients aren't cars; they don't tell me their symptoms in the same way each time.
Given all of that, mistakes are inevitable.
So if you take the system, as I was taught, and weed out all the error-prone health professionals, well there won't be anybody left.
And you know that business about people not wanting to talk about their worst cases?
On my show, on "White Coat, Black Art," I made it a habit of saying, "Here's my worst mistake," I would say to everybody from paramedics to the chief of cardiac surgery, "Here's my worst mistake," blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, "What about yours?" and I would point the microphone towards them.
And their pupils would dilate, they would recoil, then they would look down and swallow hard and start to tell me their stories.
They want to tell their stories. They want to share their stories.
They want to be able to say, "Look, don't make the same mistake I did."
What they need is an environment to be able to do that.
What they need is a redefined medical culture.
And it starts with one physician at a time.
The redefined physician is human, knows she's human, accepts it, isn't proud of making mistakes, but strives to learn one thing from what happened that she can teach to somebody else.
She shares her experience with others.
She's supportive when other people talk about their mistakes.
And she points out other people's mistakes, not in a gotcha way, but in a loving, supportive way so that everybody can benefit.
And she works in a culture of medicine that acknowledges that human beings run the system, and when human beings run the system, they will make mistakes from time to time.
So the system is evolving to create backups that make it easier to detect those mistakes that humans inevitably make and also fosters in a loving, supportive way places where everybody who is observing in the health care system can actually point out things that could be potential mistakes and is rewarded for doing so, and especially people like me, when we do make mistakes, we're rewarded for coming clean.
My name is Brian Goldman.
I am a redefined physician.
I'm human. I make mistakes.
I'm sorry about that, but I strive to learn one thing that I can pass on to other people.
I still don't know what you think of me, but I can live with that.
And let me close with three words of my own: I do remember.
We need to find ways to embrace these challenges, these problems, the suffering.
Because ultimately, our humanity depends on everyone's humanity.
I've learned very simple things doing the work that I do.
It's just taught me very simple things.
that each of us is more than the worst thing we've ever done.
I believe that for every person on the planet.
I think if somebody tells a lie, they're not just a liar.
I think if somebody takes something that doesn't belong to them, they're not just a thief.
I think even if you kill someone, you're not just a killer.
And because of that there's this basic human dignity that must be respected by law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country, and certainly in many parts of this globe, that the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
I don't believe that.
I actually think, in too many places, the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I believe that, despite the fact that it is so dramatic and so beautiful and so inspiring and so stimulating, we will ultimately not be judged by our technology, we won't be judged by our design, we won't be judged by our intellect and reason.
Ultimately, you judge the character of a society, not by how they treat their rich and the powerful and the privileged, but by how they treat the poor, the condemned, the incarcerated.
Because it's in that nexus that we actually begin to understand truly profound things about who we are.
I sometimes get out of balance. I'll end with this story.
I sometimes push too hard.
I do get tired, as we all do.
Sometimes those ideas get ahead of our thinking in ways that are important.
And I've been representing these kids who have been sentenced to do these very harsh sentences.
And I go to the jail and I see my client who's 13 and 14, and he's been certified to stand trial as an adult.
I start thinking, well, how did that happen?
How can a judge turn you into something that you're not?
And the judge has certified him as an adult, but I see this kid.
And I was up too late one night and I starting thinking, well gosh, if the judge can turn you into something that you're not, the judge must have magic power.
Yeah, Bryan, the judge has some magic power.
You should ask for some of that.
And because I was up too late, wasn't thinking real straight, I started working on a motion.
And I had a client who was 14 years old, a young, poor black kid.
And I started working on this motion, and the head of the motion was: "Motion to try my poor, 14-year-old black male client like a privileged, white 75-year-old corporate executive."
And I put in my motion that there was prosecutorial misconduct and police misconduct and judicial misconduct.
There was a crazy line in there about how there's no conduct in this county, it's all misconduct.
And the next morning, I woke up and I thought, now did I dream that crazy motion, or did I actually write it?
And to my horror, not only had I written it, but I had sent it to court.
A couple months went by, and I had just forgotten all about it.
And I finally decided, oh gosh, I've got to go to the court and do this crazy case.
And I got into my car and I was feeling really overwhelmed -- overwhelmed.
And I got in my car and I went to this courthouse.
And I was thinking, this is going to be so difficult, so painful.
And I finally got out of the car and I started walking up to the courthouse.
And as I was walking up the steps of this courthouse, there was an older black man who was the janitor in this courthouse.
When this man saw me, he came over to me and he said, "Who are you?"
I said, "I'm a lawyer." He said, "You're a lawyer?" I said, "Yes, sir."
And this man came over to me and he hugged me.
And he whispered in my ear.
He said, "I'm so proud of you."
And I have to tell you, it was energizing.
It connected deeply with something in me about identity, about the capacity of every person to contribute to a community, to a perspective that is hopeful.
Well I went into the courtroom.
And as soon as I walked inside, the judge saw me coming in.
He said, "Mr. Stevenson, did you write this crazy motion?"
I said, "Yes, sir. I did." And we started arguing.
And people started coming in because they were just outraged.
I had written these crazy things.
And police officers were coming in and assistant prosecutors and clerk workers.
And before I knew it, the courtroom was filled with people angry that we were talking about race, that we were talking about poverty, that we were talking about inequality.
And out of the corner of my eye, I could see this janitor pacing back and forth.
And he kept looking through the window, and he could hear all of this holler.
He kept pacing back and forth.
And finally, this older black man with this very worried look on his face came into the courtroom and sat down behind me, almost at counsel table.
About 10 minutes later the judge said we would take a break.
And during the break there was a deputy sheriff who was offended that the janitor had come into court.
And this deputy jumped up and he ran over to this older black man.
He said, "Jimmy, what are you doing in this courtroom?"
And this older black man stood up and he looked at that deputy and he looked at me and he said, "I came into this courtroom to tell this young man, keep your eyes on the prize, hold on."
I've come to TED because I believe that many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is long, but it bends toward justice.
That we cannot be full evolved human beings until we care about human rights and basic dignity.
That all of our survival is tied to the survival of everyone.
That our visions of technology and design and entertainment and creativity have to be married with visions of humanity, compassion and justice.
And more than anything, for those of you who share that, I've simply come to tell you to keep your eyes on the prize, hold on.
So you heard and saw an obvious desire by this audience, this community, to help you on your way and to do something on this issue.
Other than writing a check, what could we do?
Well there are opportunities all around us.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there's a referendum coming up this spring where actually there's going to be an effort to redirect some of the money we spend on the politics of punishment.
For example, here in California we're going to spend one billion dollars on the death penalty in the next five years -- one billion dollars.
And yet, 46 percent of all homicide cases don't result in arrest.
56 percent of all rape cases don't result.
So there's an opportunity to change that.
And this referendum would propose having those dollars go to law enforcement and safety.
And I think that opportunity exists all around us.
There's been this huge decline in crime in America over the last three decades.
And part of the narrative of that is sometimes that it's about increased incarceration rates.
What would you say to someone who believed that?
Well actually the violent crime rate has remained relatively stable.
The great increase in mass incarceration in this country wasn't really in violent crime categories.
It was this misguided war on drugs.
That's where the dramatic increases have come in our prison population.
And we got carried away with the rhetoric of punishment.
And so we have three strikes laws that put people in prison forever for stealing a bicycle, for low-level property crimes, rather than making them give those resources back to the people who they victimized.
I believe we need to do more to help people who are victimized by crime, not do less.
And I think our current punishment philosophy does nothing for no one.
And I think that's the orientation that we have to change.
Bryan, you've struck a massive chord here.
You're an inspiring person.
Thank you so much for coming to TED. Thank you.
