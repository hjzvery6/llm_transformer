In 2007, I decided that we needed to reconceptualize how we thought about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks about where they want to live and work, they should be able to choose between at least a handful of different cities that were all competing to attract new residents.
Now we're a long way away from that goal right now.
There are billions of people in developing countries who don't have even a single city that would be willing to welcome them.
But the amazing thing about cities is they're worth so much more than it costs to build them.
So we could easily supply the world with dozens, maybe hundreds, of new cities.
Now this might sound preposterous to you if you've never thought about new cities.
But just substitute apartment building for cities.
Imagine half the people who wanted to be in apartments already had them; the other half aren't there yet.
You could try and expand the capacity by doing additions on all the existing apartments.
But you know what you'd run into is those apartments and the surrounding areas have rules to avoid discomfort and the distractions of construction.
So it's extremely hard to do all of those additions.
But you could go out someplace brand new, build a brand new apartment building, as long as the rules there were ones that facilitated construction rather than getting in the way.
So I proposed that governments create new reform zones big enough to hold cities and gave them a name: charter cities.
Later I learned that at about this same time, Javier and Octavio were thinking about the challenge of reform in Honduras.
They knew that about 75,000 Hondurans every year would leave to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask, what could they do to make sure that those people could stay and do the same things in Honduras.
At one point, Javier said to Octavio, "What if we took some of our empty land -- what if we just gave it to an embassy -- give some to the U.S. embassy; give some to the Canadian embassy -- and then if people want to go work under the rules of Canada or under the rules of the United States, they can go get jobs, do everything they do on those embassy grounds that they would otherwise have to go to Canada or the U.S. to do?"
In the summer of 2009, Honduras went through a wrenching constitutional crisis.
At the next regularly scheduled election, Pepe Lobo won in a landslide on a platform that promised reform, but reconciliation as well.
He asked Octavio to be his chief of staff.
Meanwhile, I was getting ready to give a talk at TEDGlobal.
Through a process of refinement, trial and error, a lot of user testing, I tried to boil this complicated concept of charter city down to the bare essentials.
The first point was the importance of rules, like those rules that say you can't come in and disturb all the existing apartment holders.
We pay a lot of attention to new technologies, but it takes technologies and rules to get progress, and it's usually the rules that hold us back.
In the fall of 2010, a friend from Guatemala sent Octavio a link to the TEDTalk.
He showed it to Javier.
They called me.
They said, "Let's present this to the leaders of our country."
So in December we met in Miami, in a hotel conference room.
I tried to explain this point about how valuable cities are, how much more valuable they are than they cost.
And I used this slide showing how valuable the raw land is in a place like New York City: notice, land that's worth thousands of dollars, in some cases, per square meter.
But it was a fairly abstract discussion, and at some point when there was a pause, Octavio said, "Paul, maybe we could watch the TEDTalk."
So the TEDTalk laid out in very simple terms, a charter city is a place where you start with uninhabited land, a charter that specifies the rules that will apply there and then a chance for people to opt in, to go live under those rules or not.
So I was asked by the president of Honduras who said that we need to do this project, this is important, this could be the way forward for our country.
I was asked to come to Tegucigalpa and talk again on January fourth and fifth.
So I presented another fact-filled lecture that included a slide like this, which tried to make the point that, if you want to create a lot of value in a city, it has to be very big.
This is a picture of Denver, and the outline is the new airport that was built in Denver.
This airport alone covers more than 100 square kilometers.
So I was trying to persuade the Hondurans, if you build a new city, you've got to start with a site that's at least 1,000 square kilometers.
That's more than 250 hundred-thousand acres.
Everybody applauded politely.
The faces in the audience were very serious and attentive.
The leader of the congress came up on stage and said, "Professor Romer, thank you very much for your lecture, but maybe we could watch the TEDTalk.
I've got it here on my laptop."
So I sat down, and they played the TEDTalk.
And it got to the essence, which is that a new city could offer new choices for people.
There would be a choice of a city which you could go to which could be in Honduras, instead of hundreds of miles away in the North.
And it also involved new choices for leaders.
Because the leaders in the government there in Honduras would need help from partner countries, who could benefit from partner countries who help them set up the rules in this charter and the enforcement, so everybody can trust that the charter really will be enforced.
And the insight of President Lobo was that that assurance of enforcement that I was thinking about as a way to get the foreign investors to come in and build the city could be equally important for all the different parties in Honduras who had suffered for so many years from fear and distrust.
We went and looked at a site.
This picture's from there.
It easily could hold a thousand square kilometers.
And shortly thereafter, on January 19th, they voted in the congress to amend their constitution to have a constitutional provision that allows for special development regions.
In a country which had just gone through this wrenching crisis, the vote in the congress in favor of this constitutional amendment was 124 to one.
All parties, all factions in society, backed this.
To be part of the constitution, you actually have to pass it twice in the congress.
On February 17th they passed it again with another vote of 114 to one.
Immediately after that vote, on February 21st to the 24th, a delegation of about 30 Hondurans went to the two places in the world that are most interested in getting into the city building business.
One is South Korea.
This is a picture of a big, new city center that's being built in South Korea -- bigger than downtown Boston.
Everything you see there was built in four years, after they spent four years getting the permits.
The other place that's very interested in city building is Singapore.
They've actually built two cities already in China and are preparing the third.
So if you think about this practically, here's where we are.
They've got a site; they're already thinking about this site for the second city.
They're putting in place a legal system that could allow for managers to come in, and also an external legal system.
One country has already volunteered to let its supreme court be the court of final appeal for the new judicial system there.
There's designers and builders of cities who are very interested.
They even can bring with them some financing.
But the one thing you know they've already solved is that there's lots of tenants.
There's lots of businesses that would like to locate in the Americas, especially in a place with a free trade zone, and there's lots of people who'd like to go there.
Around the world, there's 700 million people who say they'd like to move permanently someplace else right now.
There's a million a year who leave Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of these are a father who has to leave his family behind to go get a job -- sometimes a single mother who has to get enough money to even pay for food or clothing.
Sadly, sometimes there are even children who are trying to get reunited with their parents that they haven't seen, in some cases, for a decade.
So what kind of an idea is it to think about building a brand new city in Honduras?
Or to build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these, around the world?
What kind of an idea is it to think about insisting that every family have a choice of several cities that are competing to attract new residents?
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends from Honduras asked me to say thank you, TED.
And it's also very risky.
What else is risky?
Eating an entire bowl of Cool Whip.
That's very risky.
Now when I started talking to companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story, and they said, "No, we want you to tell a story.
We want you to tell a story, but we just want to tell our story."
See, when I was a kid and my father would catch me in some sort of a lie -- and there he is giving me the look he often gave me -- he would say, "Son, there's three sides to every story.
There's your story, there's my story and there's the real story."
Now you see, with this film, we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, one agency willing to help me -- and that's only because I knew John Bond and Richard Kirshenbaum for years -- I realized that I would have to go on my own, I'd have to cut out the middleman and go to the companies myself with all of my team.
So what you suddenly started to realize -- or what I started to realize -- is that when you started having conversations with these companies, the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
I have friends who make great big, giant Hollywood films, and I have friends who make little independent films like I make.
And the friends of mine who make big, giant Hollywood movies say the reason their films are so successful is because of the brand partners that they have.
And then my friends who make small independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant Hollywood movies?"
And the movie is called "The Greatest Movie Ever Sold."
So how specifically will we see Ban in the film?
Any time I'm ready to go, any time I open up my medicine cabinet, you will see Ban deodorant.
While anytime I do an interview with someone, I can say, "Are you fresh enough for this interview?
Are you ready? You look a little nervous.
I want to help you calm down.
So maybe you should put some one before the interview."
So we'll offer one of these fabulous scents.
Whether it's a "Floral Fusion" or a "Paradise Winds," they'll have their chance.
We will have them geared for both male or female -- solid, roll-on or stick, whatever it may be.
That's the two-cent tour.
So now I can answer any of your questions and give you the five-cent tour.
We are a smaller brand.
Much like you talked about being a smaller movie, we're very much a challenger brand.
So we don't have the budgets that other brands have.
So doing things like this -- you know, remind people about Ban -- is kind of why were interested in it.
What are the words that you would use to describe Ban?
Ban is blank.
That's a great question.
Superior technology.
Technology's not the way you want to describe something somebody's putting in their armpit.
We talk about bold, fresh.
I think "fresh" is a great word that really spins this category into the positive, versus "fights odor and wetness."
It keeps you fresh.
How do we keep you fresher longer -- better freshness, more freshness, three times fresher.
Things like that that are more of that positive benefit.
And that's a multi-million dollar corporation.
What about me? What about a regular guy?
I need to go talk to the man on the street, the people who are like me, the regular Joes.
They need to tell me about my brand.
How would you guys describe your brand?
Um, my brand?
I don't know.
I like really nice clothes.
80's revival meets skater-punk, unless it's laundry day.
All right, what is brand Gerry?
Unique.
I guess what kind of genre, style I am would be like dark glamor.
I like a lot of black colors, a lot of grays and stuff like that.
But usually I have an accessory, like sunglasses, or I like crystal and things like that too.
If Dan were a brand, he might be a classic convertible Mercedes Benz.
The brand that I am is, I would call it casual fly.
Part hippie, part yogi, part Brooklyn girl -- I don't know.
I'm the pet guy.
I sell pet toys all over the country, all over the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my warped little industry, that's my brand.
My brand is FedEx because I deliver the goods.
Failed writer-alcoholic brand.
Is that something?
I'm a lawyer brand.
I'm Tom.
Well we can't all be brand Tom, but I do often find myself at the intersection of dark glamor and casual fly.
And what I realized is I needed an expert.
I needed somebody who could get inside my head, somebody who could really help me understand what they call your "brand personality."
And so I found a company called Olson Zaltman in Pittsburg.
They've helped companies like Nestle, Febreze, Hallmark discover that brand personality.
If they could do it for them, surely they could do it for me.
You brought your pictures, right?
I did. The very first picture is a picture of my family.
So tell me a little bit how it relates to your thoughts and feelings about who you are.
These are the people who shape the way I look at the world.
Tell me about this world.
This world? I think your world is the world that you live in -- like people who are around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the job you do.
All those things stemmed and started from one place, and for me they stemmed and started with my family in West Virginia.
What's the next one you want to talk about?
The next one: This was the best day ever.
How does this relate to your thoughts and feelings about who you are?
It's like, who do I want to be?
I like things that are different.
I like things that are weird. I like weird things.
Tell me about the "why" phase -- what does that do for us?
What is the machete? What pupa stage are you in now?
Why is it important to reboot? What does the red represent?
Tell me a little bit about that part.
... A little more about you that is not who you are.
What are some other metamorphoses that you've had?
... Doesn't have to be fear. What kind of roller coaster are you on?
EEEEEE! No, thank you.
Thanks for you patience.
Yeah. All right.
Yeah, I don't know what's going to come of this.
There was a whole lot of crazy going on in there.
The first thing we saw was this idea that you had two distinct, but complementary sides to your brand personality -- the Morgan Spurlock brand is a mindful/play brand.
Those are juxtaposed very nicely together.
And I think there's almost a paradox with those.
And I think some companies will just focus on one of their strengths or the other instead of focusing on both.
Most companies tend to -- and it's human nature -- to avoid things that they're not sure of, avoid fear, those elements, and you really embrace those, and you actually turn them into positives for you, and it's a neat thing to see.
What other brands are like that?
The first on here is the classic, Apple.
And you can see here too, Target, Wii, Mini from the Mini Coopers, and JetBlue.
Now there's playful brands and mindful brands, those things that have come and gone, but a playful, mindful brand is a pretty powerful thing.
A playful, mindful brand. What is your brand?
If somebody asked you to describe your brand identity, your brand personality, what would you be?
Are you an up attribute? Are you something that gets the blood flowing?
Or are you more of a down attribute?
Are you something that's a little more calm, reserved, conservative?
Up attributes are things like being playful, being fresh like the Fresh Prince, contemporary, adventurous, edgy or daring like Errol Flynn, nimble or agile, profane, domineering, magical or mystical like Gandalf.
Or are you more of a down attribute?
Are you mindful, sophisticated like 007?
Are you established, traditional, nurturing, protective, empathetic like the Oprah?
Are you reliable, stable, familiar, safe, secure, sacred, contemplative or wise like the Dalai Lama or Yoda?
Over the course of this film, we had 500-plus companies who were up and down companies saying, "no," they didn't want any part of this project.
They wanted nothing to do with this film, mainly because they would have no control, they would have no control over the final product.
But we did get 17 brand partners who were willing to relinquish that control, who wanted to be in business with someone as mindful and as playful as myself and who ultimately empowered us to tell stories that normally we wouldn't be able to tell -- stories that an advertiser would normally never get behind.
They enabled us to tell the story about neuromarketing, as we got into telling the story in this film about how now they're using MRI's to target the desire centers of your brain for both commercials as well as movie marketing.
We went to San Paulo where they have banned outdoor advertising.
In the entire city for the past five years, there's no billboards, there's no posters, there's no fliers, nothing.
And we went to school districts where now companies are making their way into cash-strapped schools all across America.
What's incredible for me is the projects that I've gotten the most feedback out of, or I've had the most success in, are ones where I've interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands did.
They cut out the middleman, they cut out their agencies and said, "Maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to deal directly with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that's going to get people thinking, that's going to challenge the way we look at the world."
And how has that been for them? Has it been successful?
Well, since the film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, let's take a look.
According to Burrelles, the movie premiered in January, and since then -- and this isn't even the whole thing -- we've had 900 million media impressions for this film.
That's literally covering just like a two and a half-week period.
That's only online -- no print, no TV.
The film hasn't even been distributed yet.
It's not even online. It's not even streaming.
It's not even been out into other foreign countries yet.
So ultimately, this film has already started to gain a lot of momentum.
And not bad for a project that almost every ad agency we talked to advised their clients not to take part.
What I always believe is that if you take chances, if you take risks, that in those risks will come opportunity.
I believe that when you push people away from that, you're pushing them more towards failure.
I believe that when you train your employees to be risk averse, then you're preparing your whole company to be reward challenged.
I feel like that what has to happen moving forward is we need to encourage people to take risks.
We need to encourage people to not be afraid of opportunities that may scare them.
Ultimately, moving forward, I think we have to embrace fear.
We've got to put that bear in a cage.
Embrace fear. Embrace risk.
One big spoonful at a time, we have to embrace risk.
And ultimately, we have to embrace transparency.
Today, more than ever, a little honesty is going to go a long way.
And that being said, through honesty and transparency, my entire talk, "Embrace Transparency," has been brought to you by my good friends at EMC, who for $7,100 bought the naming rights on eBay.
Turning big data into big opportunity for organizations all over the world.
EMC presents: "Embrace Transparency."
Thank you very much, guys.
So, Morgan, in the name of transparency, what exactly happened to that $7,100?
That is a fantastic question.
I have in my pocket a check made out to the parent organization to the TED organization, the Sapling Foundation -- a check for $7,100 to be applied toward my attendance for next year's TED.
